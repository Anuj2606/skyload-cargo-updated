# Skyload Cargo Optimization

## Overview
Skyload Cargo is a web application designed to optimize the cargo loading process for airlines using the fractional knapsack algorithm. It helps calculate the most efficient way to load cargo items onto an aircraft based on their weight, value, priority, time sensitivity, temperature sensitivity, and fragility.

The project consists of a frontend built with React and a backend using Node.js and MySQL. The application allows users to input cargo details, optimize the loading, and export the results to an Excel file.

## Features
- Add cargo items with details like weight, value, priority, time sensitivity, temperature sensitivity, and fragility.
- Calculate the total value of cargo that can be loaded into the aircraft, considering the knapsack capacity.
- Optimize cargo loading based on the fractional knapsack algorithm.
- Export the cargo data to an Excel file.
- Intuitive user interface with modern design using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Excel Export**: ExcelJS
- **API**: RESTful API for cargo optimization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
